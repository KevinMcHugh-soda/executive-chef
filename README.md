Welcome to Executive Chef - a game where you run a restaurant and invent dishes to delight customers.

The game resembles a card game, with elements of drafting, trick-taking, and hand-building.

You're also able to invest in staff and upgrade your kitchen.

The game is implemented in go with a TUI powered by charmbracelet: https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea

The architecture of the game is inspired by the architecture of balatno: https://github.com/KevinMcHugh-soda/balatno-zed
